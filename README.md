  ## Description
This is a mock backend for a social network using mongoDB and mongoose. Users can be added/deleted/updated, in addition thoughts can be added and reactions to those thoughts. Along with GET/DELETE/UPDATE respectively.

  ## Usage
This application can only run on your local host, with mongoDB already installed. Routes can be tested using an application like Insommia. See the walk through videos to see the application in use.

  ## Installation
  - First clone the respository.
  - Create your own `.env` file using the .env_example as a template.
  - open the `db` folder and connect to mysql. Run the command `source schema.sql` to create the database.
  - now open the `server.js` folder and install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
  - run `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start up the server and create the models.
  - kill the server and run `npm run seed` to seed the database with the table seeds.
  - now the application is seeded and ready to run again.
  - enjoy!
