  ## Description
This is a mock backend for a social network using mongoDB and mongoose. Users can be added/deleted/updated, in addition thoughts can be added and reactions to those thoughts. Along with GET/DELETE/UPDATE respectively.

  ## Usage
This application can only run on your local host, with mongoDB already installed. Routes can be tested using an application like Insommia. See the walk through videos to see the application in use.
